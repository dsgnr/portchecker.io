[![CodeQL](https://github.com/dsgnr/portchecker.io/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dsgnr/portchecker.io/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

This project aims to be a simple, go-to place for querying the port status for a provided hostname or IP address.
The system is API-based and making a `POST` request to the API will trigger an AWS Lambda function.

The front-end is built using React, and is forked from [ofnullable/react-spa-template](https://github.com/ofnullable/react-spa-template).
