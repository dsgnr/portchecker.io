### Getting Started
The project consists of two containers. The front-end is a static HTML file sat behind Nginx. The back-end is a simple API built using FastAPI.

The project aims to be super simple, with low overhead and also the least amount of dependencies as possible.

The project contains both production and development stacks. The production stack utilises Gunicorn as the API's gateway interface, whereas development utilises `uvicorn`.

Bringing up the development stack:
~~~
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up  --build
~~~

Bringing up the API outside of Docker;
~~~
$ cd backend/api; uvicorn main:app --reload
~~~

Bringing up the UI outside of Docker;
~~~
$ cd frontend/web; yarn install; yarn dev
~~~

The port checker API will be running at [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000) and the front-end will be running at [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080).

## Configuration
The following configuration options are available. These would be set within the Docker compose files.

### API:
- ALLOW_PRIVATE (boolean, default false)

### UI:
- DEFAULT_PORT (integer, default 443)
